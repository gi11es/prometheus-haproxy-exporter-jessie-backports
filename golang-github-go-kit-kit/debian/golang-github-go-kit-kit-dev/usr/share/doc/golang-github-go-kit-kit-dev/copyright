Comment: Apart from the files described in the next section, this whole
 directory is not properly licensed.
 .
 The LICENSE file in the directory is copied verbatim from the log15 project.
 .
 The log/term/colorwriter_windows.go file claims to be based on
 github.com/mattn/go-colorable, but the code seems to be divergent enough, and
 there is no explicit copyright assignment, so I am assuming it is governed by
 the top-level LICENSE file.
 .
 The rest of the files in that directory were created by members of the go-kit
 project and did not add any copyright claim, thus I am assuming they are also
 under the main LICENSE.
 .
 To clarify all these matters, a bug has been opened at
 https://github.com/go-kit/kit/issues/640
