Description: Go platform API for OpenTracing
 By offering consistent, expressive, vendor-neutral APIs for popular platforms,
 OpenTracing makes it easy for developers to add (or switch) tracing
 implementations with an O(1) configuration change. OpenTracing also offers a
 lingua franca for OSS instrumentation and platform-specific tracing helper
 libraries.
 .
 This package is a Go platform API for OpenTracing.
