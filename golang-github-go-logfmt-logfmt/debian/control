Description: Marshals and unmarshals logfmt messages
 Package logfmt implements utilities to marshal and unmarshal data in the
 logfmt format (https://brandur.org/logfmt). It provides an API similar
 to encoding/json (http://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/) and encoding/xml
 (http://golang.org/pkg/encoding/xml/).
 .
 The logfmt format has not been formally standardized. The most authoritative
 public specification to date has been the documentation of a Go Language
 package (http://godoc.org/github.com/kr/logfmt) written by Blake Mizerany and
 Keith Rarick.
 .
 This project attempts to conform as closely as possible to the prior art,
 while also removing ambiguity where necessary to provide well behaved encoder
 and decoder implementations.
